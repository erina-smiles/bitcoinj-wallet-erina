Bitcoin Wallet Application
This is my customized implementation of a Bitcoin Wallet Application built using bitcoinj, a Java library for working with the Bitcoin protocol.
The wallet can:
‚Ä¢	Maintain addresses and keys
‚Ä¢	Send/receive transactions
‚Ä¢	Provide balance information through APIs
‚Ä¢	Run without needing a local copy of Bitcoin Core (uses SPV mode)
Bitcoinj works in SPV (Simplified Payment Verification) mode, meaning only a lightweight part of the blockchain is downloaded, making it suitable for constrained devices like smartphones or lightweight servers.
